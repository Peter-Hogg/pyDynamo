Puncta
================

Drawing
---------------

Dynamo also allows drawing puncta on top of stack images.
Puncta are treated as a single points, with 3D position as well as a size (radius).

**Puncta mode (P)**
  Use 'P' to enter and exit puncta mode.
  While in puncta mode, the bottom of each stack window will show:

  .. figure:: ../img/initialOptions.png
    :align: center

**Selecting puncta**
  Puncta will appear in four states:

**Adding puncta**
  To add a new point, click on empty space. A point will be created on that stack, as well as later ones.

**Moving puncta**
  Each puncta has two things that can be changed.
  Shift-Click will move the center of the selected puncta to the desired location,

**Deleting puncta**
